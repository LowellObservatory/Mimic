dome rotates 360 degrees in 110 seconds
dome coasts about 1.5 to 2 degrees after motor turned off
  this means the move time is one second less than calculated
the dome parks at 45 degrees, this may be offset from the barcode reader by 100 degrees
  we'll have to test this
Dome motion ramp up time so small as to be negligible
opening the shutter
  85 seconds for upper shutter, 45 seconds for lower shutter
  MOVE waits 100 seconds and 60 seconds respectively
the azimuth the dome needs to be set to for a given azimuth of the telescope
  is a non-trivial relationship unless the alt-az axes of the telescope
  are exactly in the center of the dome.  this calculation may be complex
  Larry will provide more information soon
